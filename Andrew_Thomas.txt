Hello my name is Andrew Thomas

I am going into my fourth and final year at ISU where I have been majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics

My strongest programming language is probably python, but I am very comfortable with matlab and c++

I have been doing research and work with cfd analysis and aerodynamic shape optimization for the past 2-ish years under Dr. Ping He
I love the subject and hope to make a career out of it. I have an internship at Textron this summer for exactly this.

A fun fact about me is that I built my own cnc router
